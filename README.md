Two scripts - One for grabbing a list of UK phone codes from a website and another that calculates the distance between those codes / places.

A challenge in an LPIC study guide I had was to test if a given phone area code was within 100 KM of your own. I decided to write it in python.

These were my first python programs, I may well re-visit and do things better!
