Two scripts - One for grabbing a list of UK phone codes from a website and another that calculates the distance between those codes / places.

A challenge in an LPIC study guide I had was to test if a given phone area code was within 100 KM of your own. I'm pretty sure in the USA there is more or a stricter inherent logic in the codes themselves that would make this easy with just a bash script. As that isn't the case in the UK I decided to try and learn some python so I could do this.

It was a bit of a journey, but these are the results!
